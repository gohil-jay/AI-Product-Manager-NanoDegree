# Project 2 : Build a model with Google Cloud AutoML

In this project, we are going to take the next step and build the classification model that would serve as the backbone of this product. (Don't worry, there's no coding involved!) For this task, we will use Google AutoML, an automated machine learning tool that will allow us to build the model and host it in the cloud. In order to appreciate how training data impact models, we will build models with 4 variants of the dataset. This project is designed to test your ability to :

- build a model using Google's AutoML Vision platform, and
- understand how properties of data impact performance of models.

For the accomplishment of the project, you'll build four models using Google Cloud AutoML with four different variations on a medical imaging dataset. You'll have the opportunity to observe how properties of the data impact the models' results.

# Project 1 : Create a Medical Image Annotation Job

Your goal, as a product owner is to build a product that helps doctors quickly identify cases of pneumonia in children. You'll want to build a classification system that
- Can help flag serious cases
- Quickly identify healthy cases
- And, generally, act as a diagnostic aid for doctors

As such, this project is designed to test your ability to build a labeled dataset that distinguishes between healthy and pneumonia x-ray images; this can be used by ML engineers later on down the line to build a classification product. Your main task will be to create a data labeling job using Appen's platform.

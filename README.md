# AI Product Manager NanoDegree
This repository contains the projects submitted as a part of NanoDegree program offered by Udacity for "AI Product Manager".

# Project 1 : Create a Medical Image Annotation Job

Your goal, as a product owner is to build a product that helps doctors quickly identify cases of pneumonia in children. You'll want to build a classification system that
- Can help flag serious cases
- Quickly identify healthy cases
- And, generally, act as a diagnostic aid for doctors

As such, this project is designed to test your ability to build a labeled dataset that distinguishes between healthy and pneumonia x-ray images; this can be used by ML engineers later on down the line to build a classification product. Your main task will be to create a data labeling job using Appen's platform.

# Project 2 : Build a model with Google Cloud AutoML

In this project, we are going to take the next step and build the classification model that would serve as the backbone of this product. (Don't worry, there's no coding involved!) For this task, we will use Google AutoML, an automated machine learning tool that will allow us to build the model and host it in the cloud. In order to appreciate how training data impact models, we will build models with 4 variants of the dataset. This project is designed to test your ability to :

- build a model using Google's AutoML Vision platform, and
- understand how properties of data impact performance of models.

For the accomplishment of the project, you'll build four models using Google Cloud AutoML with four different variations on a medical imaging dataset. You'll have the opportunity to observe how properties of the data impact the models' results.

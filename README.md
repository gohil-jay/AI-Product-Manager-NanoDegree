# AI Product Manager NanoDegree
This repository contains the projects submitted as a part of NanoDegree program offered by Udacity for "AI Product Manager".

# Project 1 : Create a Medical Image Annotation Job

Your goal, as a product owner is to build a product that helps doctors quickly identify cases of pneumonia in children. You'll want to build a classification system that
- Can help flag serious cases
- Quickly identify healthy cases
- And, generally, act as a diagnostic aid for doctors

As such, this project is designed to test your ability to build a labeled dataset that distinguishes between healthy and pneumonia x-ray images; this can be used by ML engineers later on down the line to build a classification product. Your main task will be to create a data labeling job using Appen's platform.

# Project 2 : Build a model with Google Cloud AutoML

In this project, we are going to take the next step and build the classification model that would serve as the backbone of this product. (Don't worry, there's no coding involved!) For this task, we will use Google AutoML, an automated machine learning tool that will allow us to build the model and host it in the cloud. In order to appreciate how training data impact models, we will build models with 4 variants of the dataset. This project is designed to test your ability to :

- build a model using Google's AutoML Vision platform, and
- understand how properties of data impact performance of models.

For the accomplishment of the project, you'll build four models using Google Cloud AutoML with four different variations on a medical imaging dataset. You'll have the opportunity to observe how properties of the data impact the models' results.

# Project 3 : Create an AI Product Business Proposal

In this project, you'll develop a business proposal for an AI product. There are several important aspects of product development you'll need to think about and describe, and they are exactly the topics we've covered in this course. Here, we'll walk through what should be included in the proposal. You'll also find instructions in the Capsone Project Starter File, linked at the bottom of the page. You need to answer the questions in this file to complete the project.

This project is open-ended in that you can propose any product in any industry that you want! If you're stuck, feel free to think about and research one of the use cases we've already discussed in this course. As a tip, you may find that your strongest ideas come from business arenas you are interested in and may already know a lot about.

- **The Business Goal** : You'll need to describe what the product is, and how it will provide value to the business. It's important in this section to describe exactly what the product will do and why/how this helps the business. Focus on linking the AI/ML task to business goals such as increasing revenue or customer happiness.
- **Success Metrics** : You'll also need to describe how you'll know whether the product is successful. Think about measurable, predictive, comparable, and benchmarked metrics for business success.

- **Data** : You should carefully consider how you will acquire the data to train your model, and issues that may arise during data collection. Important considerations include: buying data vs. collecting it, personally identifying information (PII) and data sensitivity, cost, and whether data will be continuously available or acquired in one large batch (and need to be refreshed).
- **Model** : When thinking about how you will build the model, will you use an in-house data science team because none of the out of the box platforms have your use case, or because you want the ability to control a particular aspect of your model? Frequently, when you use an external platform to build and host the model, their terms of service will require you to give them access to your data. Will this be an issue?
- **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** : You'll want to think about what your product is. What does it look like? Who uses it, and how do they use it? How will you actually build it?
- **Post MVP Deployment** : Finally, what happens after launch? How do you ensure your product continues to perform well? Who will monitor it, how will they monitor it, and how often?

In this project, you'll propose an AI product. You'll think about all the key aspects of developing and building such a product, from its business rationale, to its roll-out, to its post-deployment monitoring.
